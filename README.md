# SwiftUI CustomAlignmentStack
VStack / HStack with overridable alignment modifier. 
I also was originally going to post only VStack so repo's name got set in this way lol

Use it as if you are using regular V/HStack, and apply `.preferredHAlignment` of `.preferredVAlignment` on element you want to overrid the alignment.
Use `.preferredHAlignment` on `CustomAlignmentVStack` and `.preferredVAlignment` on `CustomAlignmentHStack`
